    I try to keep Trello boards for all the things that I'm working on. Below, I have linked some of the Trello boards of projects that I'm working on at the moment.
    <h2>RasPi Gameboy Project</h2>
    Using a Gameboy Advance Shell, let's build a portable retro gaming system.

    <h2>College Things</h2>
    How I organize all the homework, club activities, and other parts of my life.
