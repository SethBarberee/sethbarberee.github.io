This was actually my first custom keyboard build. I was moving from my Corsair
STRAFE RGB which had Cherry MX Browns. Bought the Rev 2 PCB from keeb.io. For the switches, I was new to switch game so I did some research for alternative tactile keyswitches. I read some decent reviews and got a good deal on some Kailh Pro Purples from Novekeys. I got some decently priced red LEDs to put in the switches and RGB Strips.
