I've got quite a few custom keyboards that I have built. Below are a list of the keyboards that I have built with links. Each keyboard links to a page with more info and review of each keyboard.

 Generate each keyboard in the collection and link to the page

    <th>Pics</th>

{% for c in site.keyboards %}
<tr>
    <td><a href="{{ c.url }}">{{ c.title }}</a></td>
    <td>{{ c.keyswitch }}</td>
    <td>{{ c.price }}</td>
    <td>{{ c.pics }}</td>

{% endfor %}
