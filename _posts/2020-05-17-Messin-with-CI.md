Now that I got Travis CI set up, I can actually use other plugins that Github
Pages doesn't support, like paginate-v2. Can't wait to try them out but it was
a headache since I didn't know how Travis CI works. Luckily YAML and
documentation isn't too hard to figure out. I did find some blog posts around
the internet showing me how it's done so I did try to follow those. However,
as evidenced by the CI errors, I had a few things happen to me hah. Now, I
better try the new features and see what happens. 

Other updates:
* Azur Lane Sorter GUI is coming along nicely. Most buttons and functionality
  work
* RPI Emulator stalled until I can get a dremel.
