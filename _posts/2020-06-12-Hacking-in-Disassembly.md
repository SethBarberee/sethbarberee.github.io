title: Hacking in Disassembly
date: 2020-06-12
---

It's been a fun time this summer. I've been messing with the disassemblies of
Pokemon FireRed and Emerald. I have some basic C knowledge and Assembly
knowledge so I was able to figure out, for the most part, how the code worked.
FireRed was harder to change the starters vs Emerald due to having to edit
Text, Pokemon, and Trainer Parties. I only edited the first battle and didn't
update the rest of the game. If I was doing an actual hack, I probably would
have done that. This mainly took an hour once I figured out what I was doing.

## Pics or it didn't happen
Here's some screenshots where I replaced the
Kanto Starters with the Johto Starters in FireRed.

## Tutorial
TODO Seth: update with instructions on how I did it with a tutorial. If I
forgot, please open an Issue on the GitHub.
