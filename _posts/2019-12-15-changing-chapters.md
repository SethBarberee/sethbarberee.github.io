I can't believe how fast 4 years has flown by here at Texas A&M. It seemed
like I just came here in 2016 and now, I'm trying to figure out my career and
house (hello California). The change is definitely scary but hey, it'll be
fine (hehe right??). I made it through 16 credit hours and part of my sanity
needed a funeral but it'll be back in the spring. I've got 13 hours to close
out my college career. Soon, I'll do my fall evaluation for my senior resident
advisor position and close the dorms for winter break. 

In other news, I've been delving down my emulator hole again. With my 2-in-1,
DS gaming is a lot easier as I've been playing a lot of Pokemon Black 2 and
White 2. DS gaming is very interesting how far it's come. While sound still
isn't the best, graphics is very smooth and plays very well.

Besides getting my life together, I've been trying to get into personal
projects again. I have a mix of software/hardware hacks to work on for the
semester. One was understanding the backbone of this website skeleton that I
borrowed from another site. I suck at frontend stuff like this so I decided to
use someone else's. Copying a form of flattery, eh. My hardware plan of a
portable GameBoy emulator is coming along. Turns out a shell of one with
buttons is only like $8.50 on eBay. If I order that with my other planned
hardware, I could easily work on it during TamuMake in February.

Well, guess I better end this one. Life is changing and flipping another page
of my life is getting closer and closer. I'm not ready at all but I guess
that's the fun.
