One of my favorite animes and near the beginning of my time of watching anime.
Date a Live is a harem anime. I love harem anime but it can be hard to deliver
in the category. Date a Live will live in the nostalgia for me but I'm aware
that it's not the top tier harem anime. (Tohka best girl). The anime does a
good job of adapting the story which is commendable. If you want to laugh and
enjoy a show, Date a Live is a solid harem that I forever love based on pure
nostalgia alone.
