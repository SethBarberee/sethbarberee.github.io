<meta name="description" content="Framework 13 I’ve retiring my Dell XPS 9575 that I got in 2019. You can see more about it here. I have been watching Framework for a while and finally pulled the trigger to get a Framework 13 AMD Edition from them. I got the DIY Version so I can experience the full thing from shell to working laptop. I sourced the exact memory (32GB Crucial) and 2TB NVMe SSD from a local computer store for less and got to work when I received the shell/motherboard. Assembly was rather simple and straightforward given the instructions and videos provided by Framework. Every step was document in text and video form so as someone that prefers a visual demonstration, I greatly appreciated this. With the memory and storage installed, I did the first boot and it booted! With a fresh laptop ready and no OS installed, it’s only natural to install Arch Linux because I use Arch BTW. Framework doesn’t support Arch as an OS on their laptops, mainly Ubuntu and Fedora. Since Arch is a rolling release distribution, most of the hardware is supported on recent kernels and works out of the box. Firmware for the laptop is delivered through FWUPD too. You might be saying “Okay, Seth, but there are downsides to this upgrade right?” and yes, you are right. I have a smaller screen (15 -&gt; 13) and no touchscreen. The upsides? Quadruple the memory (8GB to 32GB), more recent processor, and quadruple the storage (500GB to 2TB). I’m typing this post from my Framework now! Random trivia but I like to name every computer I use on Linux after a Greek God/Goddesses. The Dell XPS was Athena and the Framework was christened as Hades." />

<h2 id="framework-13">Framework 13</h2>
<p>I’ve retiring my Dell XPS 9575 that I got in 2019. You can see more about it
<a href="https://sethbarberee.github.io/new-laptop-new-horizons">here</a>. I have been watching Framework for a while and
finally pulled the trigger to get a Framework 13 AMD Edition from them. I got
the DIY Version so I can experience the full thing from shell to working
laptop. I sourced the exact memory (32GB Crucial) and 2TB NVMe SSD from a
local computer store for less and got to work when I received the
shell/motherboard. Assembly was rather simple and straightforward given the
instructions and videos provided by Framework. Every step was document in text
and video form so as someone that prefers a visual demonstration, I greatly
appreciated this. With the memory and storage installed, I did the first boot
and it booted! With a fresh laptop ready and no OS installed, it’s only
natural to install Arch Linux because I use Arch BTW. Framework doesn’t
support Arch as an OS on their laptops, mainly Ubuntu and Fedora. Since Arch
is a rolling release distribution, most of the hardware is supported on recent
kernels and works out of the box. Firmware for the laptop is delivered through
FWUPD too. You might be saying “Okay, Seth, but there are downsides to this
upgrade right?” and yes, you are right. I have a smaller screen (15 -&gt; 13)
and no touchscreen. The upsides? Quadruple the memory (8GB to 32GB), more
recent processor, and quadruple the storage (500GB to 2TB). I’m typing this
post from my Framework now! Random trivia but I like to name every computer I

Framework was christened as Hades.</p>

<h2 id="website-updates">Website Updates</h2>
<p>I’ve been slowly tweaking things on the site when I get time or feel like it.
I added multi-layer support on my <a href="https://sethbarberee.github.io/bike">bike map</a>. 
I have plenty of other ideas to spruce that page up but that will come another
time.</p>

<h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>I’m always busy with work but I have plans to possibly do a series on PMD:Red
to explain inner workings like the personality test, menus, etc. Since I did
most of the decompilation on these topics, I am probably the person most
qualified to write it (when I feel like it).</p>
