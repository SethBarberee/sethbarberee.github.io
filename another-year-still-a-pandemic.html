Only changes I’ve had to do was change was an API call that was modified on 0.6 for LSP but that’s understandable as the API isn’t even stable yet. Most of my config is intended to be usable on VIM too. The LSP is just a little icing on the cake that I enjoy but don’t depend on. (I slowly cannot say the same for treesitter. Dang, it’s nice.)
