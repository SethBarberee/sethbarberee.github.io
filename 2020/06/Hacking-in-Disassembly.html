FireRed was harder to change the starters vs Emerald due to having to edit
Text, Pokemon, and Trainer Parties. I only edited the first battle and didn’t
update the rest of the game. If I was doing an actual hack, I probably would
have done that. This mainly took an hour once I figured out what I was doing.
