    <meta name="description" content="I’m about two weeks into the new apartment life here in California. Given the
rage still of COVID19, I’ve already started the search for a quarantine buddy.
Humane Society website has been a great way to end the day of browsing at
cats. Hopefully, I can adopt one in the near future. I really want a kitty. In
other news, I’ve started to get the ropes on my new job as a Test Engineer at
Texas Instruments. I’ve been working at home but slowly anticipating when I
can slip into the office for like a few hours. I’m two months into the job and
my first major product project is about to ramp up. I can’t wait to work on
it. While I’ve been waiting for that, I’ve been tasked with looking over a
test program for a product and see how it aligns to the datasheet and explain
each test. Mix of hardware and software, the way I like it. Been messing with
more Vim configuration and GBA decomp stuff in the free time. The more I learn
about it, the more I am amazed about the Game Boy Advance. It was really
impressive for its features.
