a headache since I didn’t know how Travis CI works. Luckily YAML and
documentation isn’t too hard to figure out. I did find some blog posts around
the internet showing me how it’s done so I did try to follow those. However,
as evidenced by the CI errors, I had a few things happen to me hah. Now, I
better try the new features and see what happens.
