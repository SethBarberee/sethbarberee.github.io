catch up on what is going on with me right now. Besides trying to adjust to
the rest of my semester and basically college career now online, I’ve been

helped convert the hotkeys_popup to awful.popup instead of the popup doing
the drawing itself. Pretty cool, I must say. After that, doing some research
to see how calendar_popup can convert to it. We’ll see, eh.

    <p>Well, now that I am settling into the quarantine of COVID-19, I guess I should
catch up on what is going on with me right now. Besides trying to adjust to
the rest of my semester and basically college career now online, I’ve been
trying to do other things. I’ve been contributing a lot more to AwesomeWM. I
helped convert the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hotkeys_popup</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">awful.popup</code> instead of the popup doing
the drawing itself. Pretty cool, I must say. After that, doing some research
to see how <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">calendar_popup</code> can convert to it. We’ll see, eh.</p>

<p>Besides personal projects, adulting is hard. Spent the spring break searching
for apartments which was fun until dealing with the aftermath of COVID-19.
California is fun from what I’ve seen so far. Let’s hope it stays that way
when I get there for good in 2 months. Besides that, I’m taking it one day at
a time. See ya on the other side.</p>
