I’ve
had an hour and a half delay so figured I should probably write one of these
since it’s been a while. My job has kept me busy but that doesn’t mean that
any of my projects are on the backburner. PMD-Red has been pretty steady the
past year with consistent contributions from multiple people. pfero has
recently joined up and cleaned up the shoddy job that I did on the Makefile.
One of the nice benefits has been better dependency scanning and faster
builds! As we approach 25% decompiled C code, I can’t help but smile that my
initial perseverance has paid off with more and more people coming to help
this project. 
When I have some free time, I’ve been tinkering with new stuff too.
Recently, I’ve looked into cutter (python/qt alternative to Ghidra). Sometimes
Java can be a pain on linux but this isn’t one of those cases. As with most
software, I just want to do a comparison for myself and figure out what works
best for me. But at least, I can use the Ghidra decompiler in cutter!
My nvim config hasn’t really changed much despite the fast moving
environment of neovim 0.5 and 0.6. Only changes I’ve had to do was change
was an API call that was modified on 0.6 for LSP but that’s understandable
as the API isn’t even stable yet. Most of my config is intended to be usable
on VIM too. The LSP is just a little icing on the cake that I enjoy but don’t
depend on. (I slowly cannot say the same for treesitter. Dang, it’s nice.)
I’ve debated trying to make a colorscheme but given my terrible art and
creativity skills, I’m not sure how well that would go. Maybe I’ll just stick
to my challenger-deep, for now. When I am truly bored, I’ll give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Seth Barberee</name></author><summary type="html">Currently in the terminal here at Love Field, with my mask on my face.

come along to help with decomping items and Pokemon. This has allowed me to
work some more on data and shiftability. As you can see from recent PRs, most
of the story line dungeons have actually been converted to JSON to allow for
future tools to read/edit it. PoryDungeon when?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, I did pre-order a Steam Deck so can’t wait to try that out

Texas and my flaw of never communicating, sometimes my family worry about
whether I am still alive. I had to respond to my mom today saying that “Yes, I

FireRed was harder to change the starters vs Emerald due to having to edit

interesting to see how my life is changing. Just 1 month ago, I thought I
would be moving to California and starting my job in Santa Clara. Yet now, I’m
returning to my old home to work from home. I’m happy nonetheless that I still
have a job but it just shows how life can quickly change. Finals are underway
this week to which I don’t have to worry about a good majority of them. Aside
from them being online, the grades that I need to get either an A or B aren’t
too bad. I have to have a 30 on my final in my Operating Systems class to
get an A. I like these odds. It relaxes the stress of finals for me which in
turn boosts my confidence to do well. By May 10th, I should be finished with my
undergraduate college experience. I can’t believe it but it’s happening. On
that same day, I’ll pack up and leave the residence hall to return home. My
sisters are looking forward to someone else doing chores instead of them.
However, I do know that I have changed since I left home for college 4 years
ago. When I left, I was starting to explore who I really was amid bullying of
people in high school based on my families class and standing within the town.
I shoved all criticism aside to be who I wanted to be. This lesson helped me
grow and take off during college. Freshman year, I would tie with another
student to be Hall President and later, be impeached by him in his pursuit of
power. I stayed true to myself and served with passion. This would reward me
greatly as I became well-known and liked in Residence Life during my tenure as
a Resident Advisor and Residential Housing Executive Board Member. I would
voice key opinions of students at different levels and make a difference
around me. I was never in pursuit of power or something nice on my resume. I
just wanted to serve everyone around me. I wanted to be their voice and fight
for them. Of course, there were struggles and key learnings along the way.
Some of the things that I wanted to fight for just weren’t in the cards for
ResLife to feasibly achieve. I learned the inner workings of the university
and administration in order to better learn where to improve it. I never set
to create a legacy but with my gradation impending, many are reminding me how
large a figure I loomed at the university. My presence was always known and
appreciated. For once, I fit in and became a person that I wanted to be. I
grew into a mold that I created at the start. I found the key figures to look
up to and pushed myself when no one else would. I didn’t succeed at everything
but I am proud of what I did manage to do. I hope that people learned lessons
from me and become great leaders. After all, leadership isn’t just about you.
It’s about how you groom other leaders too. I never was one for the limelight
but I loved to help people get the recognition that they deserved for their
leadership. This post is probably drowning on a bit so I’ll wrap it up with
this. I won’t forget the lessons that I learned here. It’s a part of me and
made me who I am today. If someone is reading this, I hope they too can take a
lesson to heart: &lt;strong&gt;be who they want to be&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Seth Barberee</name></author><summary type="html">With two weeks to go of college amid this pandemic, it’s shocking and interesting to see how my life is changing. Just 1 month ago, I thought I would be moving to California and starting my job in Santa Clara. Yet now, I’m returning to my old home to work from home. I’m happy nonetheless that I still have a job but it just shows how life can quickly change. Finals are underway this week to which I don’t have to worry about a good majority of them. Aside from them being online, the grades that I need to get either an A or B aren’t too bad. I have to have a 30 on my final in my Operating Systems class to get an A. I like these odds. It relaxes the stress of finals for me which in turn boosts my confidence to do well. By May 10th, I should be finished with my undergraduate college experience. I can’t believe it but it’s happening. On that same day, I’ll pack up and leave the residence hall to return home. My sisters are looking forward to someone else doing chores instead of them.

catch up on what is going on with me right now. Besides trying to adjust to
the rest of my semester and basically college career now online, I’ve been
trying to do other things. I’ve been contributing a lot more to AwesomeWM. I
helped convert the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hotkeys_popup&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;awful.popup&lt;/code&gt; instead of the popup doing
the drawing itself. Pretty cool, I must say. After that, doing some research
to see how &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;calendar_popup&lt;/code&gt; can convert to it. We’ll see, eh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides personal projects, adulting is hard. Spent the spring break searching
for apartments which was fun until dealing with the aftermath of COVID-19.
California is fun from what I’ve seen so far. Let’s hope it stays that way
when I get there for good in 2 months. Besides that, I’m taking it one day at
a time. See ya on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Seth Barberee</name></author><summary type="html">Well, now that I am settling into the quarantine of COVID-19, I guess I should catch up on what is going on with me right now.

It seemed
like I just came here in 2016 and now, I’m trying to figure out my career and
house (hello California). The change is definitely scary but hey, it’ll be
fine (hehe right??). I made it through 16 credit hours and part of my sanity
needed a funeral but it’ll be back in the spring. I’ve got 13 hours to close
out my college career. Soon, I’ll do my fall evaluation for my senior resident
advisor position and close the dorms for winter break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, I’ve been delving down my emulator hole again. With my 2-in-1,
DS gaming is a lot easier as I’ve been playing a lot of Pokemon Black 2 and
White 2. DS gaming is very interesting how far it’s come. While sound still
isn’t the best, graphics is very smooth and plays very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides getting my life together, I’ve been trying to get into personal
projects again. I have a mix of software/hardware hacks to work on for the
semester. One was understanding the backbone of this website skeleton that I
borrowed from another site. I suck at frontend stuff like this so I decided to
use someone else’s. Copying a form of flattery, eh. My hardware plan of a
portable GameBoy emulator is coming along. Turns out a shell of one with
buttons is only like $8.50 on eBay. If I order that with my other planned
hardware, I could easily work on it during TamuMake in February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, guess I better end this one. Life is changing and flipping another page
of my life is getting closer and closer. I’m not ready at all but I guess
that’s the fun.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Seth Barberee</name></author><summary type="html">I can’t believe how fast 4 years has flown by here at Texas A&amp;amp;M.

&lt;p&gt;As my time at internship with Dell comes to a close, I’ve been in the market
for a new laptop to replace my older Dell Precision 5510. My shopping list or
with list was the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Better battery life&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Touchscreen of some fashion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Please no more NVIDIA graphics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;15” screen or smaller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So lemme explain, my Dell Precision gets about 3 1/2 hours of battery life.
That’s not too bad but in the world of ultrabooks and how on the go I am, I
want to have something with better battery life. Touchscreen came from a
little part of me that just wants to take notes kinda like a Surface laptop
and replace my old and basically broken Samsung Tab A. My last item came from
my constant work on Wayland testing and just dealing with hybrid graphics.
NVIDIA is a great company with good products however on the Linux side,
supporting Wayland isn’t on their highest priority and the Quadro M1000M of
mine could never boost since NVIDIA never released the signed firmwares for
them. With my laptop beginning to hit 3 years old and my current internship at
Dell, I wanted to take advantage of a good deal on a new laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;scouting&quot;&gt;Scouting&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, I had an employee discount and I don’t mind buying refurbished. My
scope was narrowed very quickly to the XPS/Latitudes of Dell. I wanted good
support on Linux which then narrowed to the XPS. Then, I settled on the 15”
after trying it in the lab and pulled the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;review&quot;&gt;Review&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve broken down each part of the laptop review to sections labeled below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;linux-driver-support&quot;&gt;Linux Driver Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most things work out of the box. Not any problems to speak of. From the Arch
wiki, the only thing that doesn’t really have a driver is the fingerprint
reader but I don’t really use/need it. The only thing that will bug me at
times is when the touchpad might be disabled after flipping between tablet and
laptop mode but I usually just do a full cycle switch between the two and it
usually fixes itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;screen&quot;&gt;Screen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s glossy and 1080P. Bring on the fingerprints from touch. I did buy a Pen with the
laptop to slightly mitigate this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;graphics&quot;&gt;Graphics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel and AMD graphics are pretty rad for gaming. Since both are open source
drivers on Linux, it’s nice. The AMD GPU powers off when not in use and can be
used with DRI_PRIME. Simple and efficient. The way it’s supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;touchscreen-gestures&quot;&gt;Touchscreen Gestures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This needed a full on section because of the differences that Linux (Arch) and
Windows do. In Linux, a one-finger drag is a basically selecting text with the
left button while on Windows, it scrolls. I hated this in Firefox when I
wanted to scroll with one finger in Linux and can’t. I ended up installing
ScrollAnywhere (Firefox Extension) to solve the issue and now I can basically
scroll like I do in Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;battery-life&quot;&gt;Battery Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reference with my Precision, I would have to charge at least once per day
during one of my classes (typically 45 mins). With the XPS, I charge about
every other day depending on how much I actually need it. Some days are more
heavy than others like Mondays while others I don’t really need it such as
my Tuesday classes. From my own testing, I typically get 6 hours and sometimes
better depending on what work I’m actually doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;on-screen-keyboard&quot;&gt;On Screen Keyboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With having a convertible laptop, a big issue is on-screen keyboards. Desktop
environments have their own keyboards or have one that is extremely integrated
to only that environment. With using LightDM, I already had onboard installed
so I tried using that. With it running in the background in docked mode, it
works really well especially in AwesomeWM. Currently, I have it set to
auto-hide when I type and show when it detects that it needs text input. An
example is when I open a new tab and onboard will popup to input. However, it
only shows when I’m in tablet mode. Great job, onboard folks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Seth Barberee</name></author><summary type="html">Written on said XPS 15 9575</summary></entry></feed>
