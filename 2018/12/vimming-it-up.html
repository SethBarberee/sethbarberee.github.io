    <p>So Christmas break is happening right now and I don’t have classes to worry
about. That’s amazing that I don’t have to be frantically coding some random
project that I will probably never use again. What it does mean is that I can
do stuff that I want to do. A few examples to illustrate my point:</p>

<ul>
  <li>My Python script to sort a JSON file of ships from Azur Lane</li>
  <li>Figuring out QMK keyboard stuff</li>
  <li>Learning how to use VIM better &lt;— MOST IMPORTANT</li>
</ul>

<p>For the month of December, some redditors from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/">r/vim</a> created 
an <a href="https://vimways.org/2018/">advent calendar</a> for Vim. With this calendar, 
articles are posted everyday to learn something new about VIM. In all honestly,
I’ve learned quite a bit.</p>

<h2 id="vimways-to-the-rescue">Vimways to the rescue</h2>
<p>I consider myself quite a beginner still with Vim. I have converted to using
it daily for any bit of code that I have to write. But with that commitment, I
have amassed a decently sized init.vim that can be a hassle to manage.
<a href="https://vimways.org/2018/from-vimrc-to-vim/">December 3</a> was a great help as
it demonstrated how to split up my init.vim. You can see how it looks 
<a href="https://github.com/SethBarberee/dotfiles/tree/master/neovim/.config/nvim">here</a>. 
Cool, right? Pretty much a file for each plugin that I have installed… 
And Vim loads them on startup, wow. Combine the load guards in those files
with vim-plug’s lazy-load ability and I can narrow out what gets loaded and
what doesn’t. Thanks to those people who submitted articles to Vimways! It
really helped a lot. If you haven’t read them yet, give them a look <a href="https://vimways.org/2018">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="hacking-around">Hacking around</h2>
<p>Well, now that formalities are exchanged with Vim. The real learning begins
now as I dive off the deep cliff by looking at other people’s configs and
tweak mine to better serve myself. Maybe mess with folding?? Who knows….</p>
