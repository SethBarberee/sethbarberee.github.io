I've got quite a few custom keyboards that I have built. Below are a list of the keyboards that I have built with links.

[](Maybe add a table instead??)

* Keebio Iris [](TODO add build log and keymap)
* Whitefox (Kickstarter Kit) (still sourcing parts to finish)
* ErgoTravel (waiting on group buy to ship)
